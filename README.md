## 💡 Thoughts / Notes

- ⏰ I timeboxed this project to one evening to see how much I could get done.
- 📦 I had some issues getting Docker working on my Mac so I was not able to get this project contanerised.
- ⚛️ I took the opportunity to try and learn React Query as part of this project.
  - It is really nice and super powerful, I am looking forward to learning more about it.
- 🖼 When designing this I decided to imagine it more as a micro app which couold be embedded on a bigger product page so I decided to go for a minimal design.
